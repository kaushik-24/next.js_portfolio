  <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
  <p>
    This is my modern, minimalist portfolio built with 
    <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and 
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>. It showcases my work, skills, 
    and projects with a sleek and responsive design, ensuring an optimal experience across 
    devices. The site includes custom animations, smooth transitions, and a dark/light theme 
    toggle powered by the ThemeProvider. Components are optimized for performance and scalability, 
    using Next.js features like client-side and server-side rendering.
